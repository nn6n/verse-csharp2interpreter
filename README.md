# Verse Interpreter Project

This project is an interpreter for the programming language 'Verse'.
For more information about how to use the interpreter please check out the
PDF file which serves as a guide to use the interpreter and also to explain the
implemented features and some syntax deviations.

We also added a release to the repo, where you can download the exe file and execute some Verse code if you like to. 
Just keep in mind it is still work in progress and experimental, so there can be some bugs.
There are also some '.verse' test files which can be executed with the interpreter.
